# WeCookin

Welcome to our project: WeCookin! Built in two weeks, our goal was to make cooking with recipes easier and more accessible for all. No more spending a whole lot of time searching for the perfect recipe when you can just ask and receive!

## The In-Depth Explanation
WeCookin utilizes the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate recipes in real-time! With a prompt that's over 1,700 words long, we ensure that it returns exactly what we are looking for in a recipe: easy-to-follow, simple to make, and customizable. We've also implemented a **settings** menu, where you can enter allergens and dietary restrictions to even further narrow down what you want your recipe to look like.

The interface, the features, and everything you see except the ChatGPT API itself is made from the ground-up.

## The Features
We have main features: generating a recipe, saving a recipe, a bookmark bar, and a settings page for all sorts of dietary restrictions.

### Generating a Recipe
When you type something into the chatbox, it sends a request to the API, getting a response. Just like how you can ask ChatGPT something, except this is embedded into the code and you don't need to talk to ChatGPT manually. The output that ChatGPT gives is then saved into multiple fields, including the name of the food, ingredients, nutritions, description, and instructions. It then outputs it onto the page.
