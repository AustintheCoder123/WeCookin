    <p>🍔 Classic Beef Burger Recipe
        🔪 Ingredients (Makes 4 burgers):
        For the patty:

        1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 for juiciness)

        1 tsp salt

        1/2 tsp black pepper

        1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)

        1/2 tsp onion powder (optional)

        For the assembly:

        4 burger buns (brioche, sesame, or your choice)

        4 slices cheddar cheese (or any cheese you like)

        Lettuce leaves

        Tomato slices

        Onion slices (red or white)

        Pickles (optional)

        Ketchup, mustard, mayo (your choice)</p>

    <p>🍳 Instructions:
        Make the patties:

        In a bowl, mix ground beef with salt, pepper, and optional spices (don’t overmix).

        Form into 4 equal patties, slightly larger than your buns (they shrink when cooking).

        Press a small indent in the center of each patty with your thumb (prevents puffing up).

        Cook the patties:

        Pan or grill: Heat over medium-high heat. Add a little oil if using a pan.

        Cook patties 3–4 minutes per side for medium doneness.

        In the last minute, add cheese on top and cover to melt.

        Toast the buns:

        Lightly butter the insides of the buns and toast them on the pan/grill until golden.

        Assemble the burger:

        Bottom bun → Sauce → Lettuce → Patty with cheese → Tomato → Onion → Pickles → Sauce → Top bun.
